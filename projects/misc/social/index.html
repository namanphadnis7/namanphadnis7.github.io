            <p> I created weekly instagram posts for University of Maryland's Dining Services, called "What's that Dish" Wednesdays to increase student engagement. Students would guess the mystery dish to win dining services' prizes. It was my own idea and very fun to design. </p>

                <p>I decided to make comic-book-themed posts to still give it a youthful touch and hype. I made the anime speed effect lines, but couldn't quite get the dots right. I saw a similar dot pattern on the window borders of my campus shuttle bus, which inspired me to make it this way in the final design.</p>
