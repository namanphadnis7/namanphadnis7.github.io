            <p>
                To understand the problem space better, I framed some "How Might We?" questions. Asking these questions to myself resulted in a lot of issues emerging in the world of esports which I wanted to improve. I narrowed these questions down to a limited scope to keep my project viable and then worked on finding an answer through design.

                I created mockups to show expansion of the promotion of esports outside  game-specific platforms. This isn't limited to one idea but many- ads on mainstream tv, news articles with esports section inside the sports section, Netflix documentaries, more esports involvement in in-person events and college festivals, etc.
