                <p>This was a collaborative group project for our client, the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland.</p>
                <p> We conducted research with students in the department of Information Science to get insights into the program and provide solutions to improve it for the students.

            <p>
                The client wanted to promote their Information Science program in a better way for current and prospective students. Trends showed that many people did not know about the existence of the program itself, and a significant portion of the students were transferred from other departments. The college wanted to work on creating a unique identity for the program.

                It is very important to know your users before you design for them, therefore we interviewed the students before the ideation phase.

                After making an affinity diagram using the data we got from the user interviews, our team built experience models to portray the users and their obstacles in terms of their identity and their relationships.

                <p>We crafted some identities of the students in and around the program based on the sentimental data from the affinity diagram. The identities were divided into three sections, based on who they were, what they wanted, and what they liked. We also gave each identity a 'Give Me' section, coming up with what this identity would want to improve their experience in the iSchool.</p>

We divided this into three sections as well with increasing levels of scope, their relationship with themselves, their program, and the rest of the world, which provided a large overview of their decision-making process within the program.</p>
